# SwatchGenerator
A project to create a set of pixel art palette creation tools, beginning with a swatch generator.

The application initially will create a palette for the user, and the user will be able to create various types of palettes, although the intial type will be a monochrome palette. The palette creation tool will allow the user to create various small palettes and get complimentary colors.

Stretch goals for this project include:
-Adding other types of swatches (aside from monochrome)
-Creating a better GUI, preferably not a hand typed one because I seriously hate myself right now, like NetBeans exists, use it
-Randomly creating color swatches based on the Hue Ramp and Multi-color schemes
-Being able to look at an image and give the user the percentages of colors used in the image, used for anti-aliasing guidelines
-Allowing the user the ability to draw within the application itself, pre-setting colors with their generated color swatches
-being able to select areas in a given image and give the percentages of colors used.
